# spicebag-fivem-optimizer
A simple optimizer for FiveM based on the one created by ZYZNN.

I mean yeah, honestly theres not much to it.
If you struggle to run FiveM this may help,

What this aims to do :
- Clear your game cache
- Increase your frames by closing some background programs that lower your FPS.
- Set your windows power-plan to a high performance one designed purely for performance.
